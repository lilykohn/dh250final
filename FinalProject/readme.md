# Final Project Proposal 
### Individual Project by Lily kohn

## Research Question
Beginning in April 2020, a number of news stories came out regarding mass burials as a result of COVID-19 taking place on NYC's Hart Island. Hart Islandâ€™s cemetery dates back to 1869, and for over 150 years has been used as a burial ground for over 1 million unclaimed and unidentified New Yorkers. During the early days of the pandemic, when NYC was the epicenter of COVID-19 related deaths in the US, newfound attention was placed on Hart Island and the vast amount of unclaimed bodies from hospitals and nursing homes that were being buried there as a result of COVID-19. This research project will examine the landscape of Hart Island burials in 2020 as compared to years past. The number of burials, as well as the place of death will be examined.

## Project Significance
My overall research focuses on public memory and memorialization practices. I became interested in Hart Island during the pandemic and its significance as America's largest mass grave site. Historically, those who have typically received a public burial on Hart Island are individuals from the city's most vulnerable populations. I think it is important to draw attention to spaces in official memory that the state works to forget, and the disproportionate demographics of deaths during COVID-19 falls into that category. Also, as someone living in NYC, I believe understanding this landscape is crucial.

## Data Sources and Scope
The dataset for this project was found on NYC Open Data. It was last updated in June 2021 and includes the following columns: Last Name, First Name, Age, Death Date, Place of Death.

I am hoping to find additional, contextual information from The Hart Island Project: https://www.hartisland.net/ As burials on Hart Island are under the jurisdiction of the NYC Department of Corrections, the dataset provided by the state is likely to be the only data source available. 

## Scope
I think it will be intersting to examine the count of burials in Hart Island during 2020 as compared to years past, in particular comparing it to the years of the AIDS epidemic (which, prior to COVID-19, was the largest contributor to burials on Hart Island). I also hope to be able to analyze the places of death, not only mapping where they fall in terms of neighborhoods and boroughs, but also examining the type of place in which people passed (e.g. hospital, nursing home, private residence, homeless shelter, etc.) Due to the ethics surrounding this type of project, I currently plan to exclude individual names from my project scope.  

## Insights
From this project, I hope to have a better understanding of the landscape of burials on Hart Island and try to piece together how these burials fit into the larger landscape of COVID-19 deaths in NYC. The media attention that came to Hart Island in early 2020 changed a number of practices the Department of Corrections was employing for public burials. I hope to add in some of that context (i.e. the labor behind the burials and access to the graves) to this project, as well.
